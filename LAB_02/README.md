This is a menu driven program which gives 4 options to the user(1.Enter a name. 2.Search for a name. 3. Remove a name. 4. Show all the names.)
While entering a name duplicate names are not accepted.
For searching a name it checks for the name to be searched in the array of names. If the name to be searched is present in the array, then it shows a message that name is present.
For removing a name it takes the name to be removed as input and checks weather it is present in the array of names. If the name is present in the array it is removed and the idex value of remaining names are rearranged.
While showing all the names the current array of names is displayed. If any name is removed then that name will not be displayed.

CONSTRAINTS:-
1) The names collected must be stored in an array with a max length of 1024.
2) The names in the array should be UNIQUE; no duplicate entries are expected!
3) Provide necessary validations that the user enters only valid names that are not going to be repeated.
4) Removing a name should not create empty space inside the array!
5) Format your results properly!!
