Create a java program that performs the following operation:
The program should collect an integer array from the user
After the array is entered, you need to create a menu of items
1)Find the Mean Value
2)Find the Median Value
3)Find the Mode Value
From the user-given array.
The program should have a minimum of 3 functions apart from the main function; each of the functions implements the Mean, Median, and Mode computation by accepting the array user has entered as a parameter and returning the value as a result. From the main method, you will display the result.
ALGORITHM:-
* Read the size of the array.
* Enter the array elements.
* Display a menu showing options for Mean, Median and Mode.
* Ask for choice to the user.
* Create a function which calculates the mean by adding all the elements of the array and dividing the sum by total number of elements.
* Create another function which calculates median. Calculate the middle index of the array by dividing the last index by 2. Now display the element for that index in the array.
* Create another fuction which calculates the mode. Iterate through all the elements in the array and compare the every element with every other element in the array.
* Now create switch case through which the control goes to the particular function for which the use has opted.
